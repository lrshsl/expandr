 # Expandr

 > A language that compiles itself when you run it.

Standalone macro system, where each file 'expands' into a string.
Can be use to programmatically produce strings of any kind, e.g. you can expand to HTML or an elf executable or whatever else you can think of.


The idea is to create some kind of programming language that compiles itself when you run it.
